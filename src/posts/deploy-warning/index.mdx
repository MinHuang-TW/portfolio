How to resolve the warning -- **No Xcode or CLT version detected**:
The error message above is self explanatory. It saying that the node-gyp rebuild is failed, and this is because No Xcode or CLT version detected.

- Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iPadOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

- The CLT stands for “Command Line Tools for Xcode”. This package enables UNIX-style development via Terminal by installing command line developer tools, as well as macOS SDK frameworks and headers. Many useful tools are included, such as the Apple LLVM compiler, linker, and Make. If you use Xcode, these tools are also embedded within the Xcode IDE.
To solve this problem, we need to download and re-install the macOS “Command Line Tools for Xcode”


#### Step 1: Find the path to the Command Line Tools for Xcode
```
% xcode-select -print-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools 
#This is the output, is no output the Xcode is not installed. We need to install it Skip to Step 6
```

#### Step 2: Reset the path of Command Line Tools for Xcode
```
$ sudo xcode-select --reset
```

#### Step 3: Check if the path has been reset
```
$ xcode-select -print-path
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer 
#If this is the output then everything is fine. Restart your Mac just to be sure. 
If nothing changes come back here and continue with the steps
```

#### Step 4: Uninstall whatever is left of the Command Line Tools for Xcode
```
$ sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path) #There will be no output
$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTool #Just to be sure
```

#### Step 5: Install Command Line Tools for Xcode
```
$ xcode-select --install
```
