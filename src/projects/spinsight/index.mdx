<TitleAnchored>Background</TitleAnchored>

This project is a graduation project conducted with the cooperation of OfficeVitae. The shared goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge by proposing design solutions in pursuit of sustainable employee vitality promotion at work.

> How can millennial employees’ vitality be sustainably promoted in the context of work through a designed product or service?

Millennial employees’ vitality at work is significantly affected by the harmony in the fulfillment of work and life achievement. The project explored possibilities of enriching life through drawing new inspirations from colleagues to achieve work-life harmony. SpInsight is a digital interactive platform encouraging millennial employees to explore non-work-related aspects of colleagues with the aim of taking a short mental switch from work. It potentially triggers more face-to-face non-work-related interaction with colleagues, which in turn enhances vitality at work.

<TitleAnchored>Research Findings</TitleAnchored>

> What is the millennial employees’ vitality goal at work?

Through literature and user-centric research (contextmapping), vitality themes and factors were formulated. Millennial employees’ vitality at work is significantly affected by the intrapersonal and organizational factors. They are seeking the harmony in the fulfillment of work and life achievement, which was identified as the ultimate goal in terms of the long-term influence and salient impact on millennial employees.

The research phase was concluded with the selected vitality direction Life Enrichment through drawing new inspirations from colleagues on account of social interaction and active participation, which are successful long-term implementing criteria identified from existing products.

<TitleAnchored>Insights From Research Through Design</TitleAnchored>

> How can millennial employees’ vitality goal be sustainably promoted at work through a designed product or a service?

Four generated concepts were tested in a startup company and the results were assessed by the vitality criteria, etc. The curiosity about the non-work-related side of colleagues was discovered as a strong intrinsic motivator. The selected concept was encouraging millennial employees to take short mental breaks via answering a non-work-related random question about colleagues and triggering interactions between them (e.g. find out the answer).

> How can the Vitality Platform support person-product interaction to achieve employees’ vitality goal in the long run? 

Optimized person-product interaction was explored through testing interactive prototypes with target users. Based on the result, the Spin Wheel(3) was chosen for:

- Optimized interaction: Inviting, evoking positive emotions 

- Better leveraging motivators: Different difficulty levels of questions

In addition, other colleague's answers are appealing and meaningful, which should be included in the further development.

<TitleAnchored>Conceptualization</TitleAnchored>

> How can millennial employees’ vitality goal be sustainably promoted at work through the Vitality Platform?

- Design Goal: A digital platform encouraging millennial employees to explore non-work-related aspects of colleagues with the aim of taking a mental switch from work

- Target Interaction: Engaging, Curious and Relaxed

The final concept SpInsight has three main functions: requesting, answering and proposing a random question about colleagues with different difficulty levels: appearance, belongings, character, experience and customized questions.

<TitleAnchored styleClass='align-top'>Final Evaluation</TitleAnchored>

An interactive prototype was evaluated in four companies. The concept worked in the group of TOPdesk interns and it potentially triggered more face-to-face non-work-related interaction with colleagues, which in turn enhances vitality at work. However, employee participants showed less motivation because of less motivating questions, lack of feedback and trigger. 

Thus, two focus groups were conducted to clarify the critical long-term motivators. The curiosity about how colleagues perceive oneself was the most powerful spark to enhance the retention (e.g. push notification like “You are mentioned in an answer.”).

<TitleAnchored>Future Development</TitleAnchored>

In general, SpInsight is feasible in a workplace and considered fun and engaging. There are some opportunities that could also benefit from its advantage of getting to know people quickly, such as an introduction program in the educational setting. 

However, how to attract group participation and sustain millennial employees’ interest and motivations over time requires further research and evaluation on different working contexts (e.g. company scale, department, the stage of group development).
