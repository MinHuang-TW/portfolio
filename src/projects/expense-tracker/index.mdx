The expense tracker aims to assist a user in managing personal finances by offering not only a basic expense check but also a brief analysis of incomes and expenses for a week, a month and a year. All operations are performed in private through a personal account.

The project is a _MERN stack_ application, deployed on _Heroku_. The front-end was developed in _HTML5_, _CSS3_ and _React.js_ while the back-end was created in _Express_ and _Node.js_. The data was stored in _MongoDB_ Atlas and users can only access their own data but otherâ€™s.

<TitleAnchored>User Story</TitleAnchored>

After login, the user can access the following key features:

- Add/ Edit/ Delete a transaction: The user can create a new income or expense transaction which can be deleted or modified after the creation.

- Check recent transactions: The user will see all transactions took place in the last three days and the sum of income, expense and balance in the personal dashboard.

- Check history transactions: The user can also check the list of previous transactions along with the sum and ratio of income and expense in a day, a week, a month and a year.

- Get an overview of incomes and expenses: All transactions of the user are accumulated to the daily, weekly and monthly total sum and visualized as a histogram. The user then gets a better understanding of the weekly, monthly and yearly fluctuation of incomes and expenses.

<TitleAnchored>Interface Design</TitleAnchored>

The visual style of this project was inspired by Andrew Tanchuk's concept, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/5271124-Personal-Budget-App?utm_source=Pinterest_Shot&utm_campaign=andrewtanchuk&utm_content=Personal%20Budget%20App&utm_medium=Social_Share#shot-description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Personal Budget App**</a>. Then, a design system was formulated based on the same philosophy such as the color theme and the flat design. Next, the wireframe of screens was elevated to high-fidelity interface design by applying the design system.

<TitleAnchored top="0">Web Development</TitleAnchored>

The project is a _MERN_ stack application, deployed on _Heroku_. Since personal financial records are sensitive information, it is necessary to keep personal data in private. Therefore, user authentication was required and verified with _JSON Web Token (JWT)_. By doing so, a user can login and log out with a personal account.

- Front-end

The front-end was built with responsive modern technologies (_HTML5_, _CSS3_, _React.js_) and complimentary by a front-end library, _Material-UI_. The data analysis was achieved by visualizing transaction data with _D3.js_. Besides, _React-spring_ was utilized to add lively animations to the react application.

- Back-end

A _REST API_ for the project was created with _Express_, _Node.js_ while the data was stored in _MongoDB_ Atlas, a NoSQL and document-oriented database in the cloud. Then, a user can perform _CRUD_ operations through this API such as create, read, update, and delete data.
