### Current Interaction

The majority of existing digital calculators do not display the calculation process. As a user performing long calculations frequently, it brings a lot of troubles since I always forget which number I have or I have not typed in and I have no choice but to start over.

### Design Goal

- Keep calculating steps until the calculation is done
- Since there are a lot of numbers displayed, the operands and the end result of per calculation should be distinguished with clear hierarchy.
- Smooth pressing interaction and animation
- Should be properly displayed across all mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone, tablet)
